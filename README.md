# CSE-373-Projects

Use this Git repository for all coding project assignments in this class.

This project is meant to be imported into IntelliJ as a Gradle project.

(In theory, it should be possible to complete our projects using the Gradle 
support in any other IDE or by using Gradle without an IDE, but the course 
staff may not be able to provide technical support if you do so.)
